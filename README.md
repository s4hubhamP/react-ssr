# Makeshift Next.js

[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RzhNYhjVAw)

This project is a barebones version of a React framework that I created to teach people why they need a framework.

## How to Use

This repo has 2 branches:

- `main` for the start, and
- `spoiled` for the finish

Feel free to jump between them to read and understand the code. Of course, feel free to clone/fork as needed for your own learning as well.
